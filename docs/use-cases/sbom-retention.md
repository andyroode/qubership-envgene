## Overview

This document covers use cases for [SBOM Retention](/docs/features/sbom-retention.md), the
automatic cleanup of cached SBOM files used to manage Instance Repository size. SBOM files are
stored under `/sboms/<application-name>/` as `<application-name>-<application-version>.sbom.json`.
See [SBOM directory layout](/docs/features/sbom.md#sbom-directory-layout) for the storage
structure.

## SBOM cleanup execution

The cleanup logic runs during effective set generation and depends only on the
`sbom_retention.enabled` flag. When enabled, per-application SBOM retention runs only if
`keep_versions_per_app` is set, then the total size of `/sboms/` is checked against the
1200 MB limit. These use cases demonstrate the observable behavior in each scenario.

### UC-SBOM-1: SBOM retention disabled - no cleanup

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Instance Repository exists with `/sboms/` directory. SBOM files are stored in
   `/sboms/<application-name>/`
2. SBOM files exist in `/sboms/<application-name>/`
3. SBOM retention is **disabled** in `/configuration/config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   # Option 1: No sbom_retention section
   ```

   or

   ```yaml
   # Option 2: Explicitly disabled
   sbom_retention:
     enabled: false
   ```

**Trigger:**

Instance pipeline (GitLab or GitHub) is started with parameters:

1. `ENV_NAMES: <env_name>`
2. `GENERATE_EFFECTIVE_SET: true`

**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs.
2. SBOM retention configuration is checked. `enabled` is false (or the section is absent).
3. SBOM cleanup is skipped.
4. The effective set generation completes.

**Results:**

1. Effective set is generated successfully
2. No SBOM files are deleted
3. Pipeline log shows: `SBOM retention policy is disabled`

### UC-SBOM-2: All applications within per-application limit - no files deleted

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Instance Repository exists with `/sboms/` directory. SBOM files are stored in
   `/sboms/<application-name>/`
2. SBOM files exist for multiple applications, with each subdirectory holding
   `keep_versions_per_app` files or fewer:
   - `/sboms/app-a/`: 7 versions
   - `/sboms/app-b/`: 4 versions
   - `/sboms/app-c/`: 10 versions
3. SBOM retention is **enabled** in `/configuration/config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   sbom_retention:
     enabled: true
     keep_versions_per_app: 10
   ```

4. Total size of `/sboms/` is 200 MB (at or below the 1200 MB limit)

**Trigger:**

Instance pipeline (GitLab or GitHub) is started with parameters:

1. `ENV_NAMES: <env_name>`
2. `GENERATE_EFFECTIVE_SET: true`

**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs.
2. SBOM retention is enabled with `keep_versions_per_app: 10`. The cleanup procedure starts.
3. Any legacy flat SBOM files at the top of `/sboms/` are removed (none in this case).
4. Per-application SBOM retention runs over each subdirectory. Every subdirectory already
   contains 10 or fewer files, so no files are deleted.
5. The total size of `/sboms/` is at or below the 1200 MB limit. The total size limit step
   does not run.
6. The effective set generation completes.

**Results:**

1. Effective set is generated successfully
2. No SBOM files are deleted
3. Pipeline log shows:
   - `SBOM retention policy is enabled for directory <path>/sboms`
   - `Directory size 200.00 MB`

### UC-SBOM-3: Per-application retention keeps 10 most recent versions

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Instance Repository exists with `/sboms/` directory
2. SBOM files exist for multiple applications under per-application subdirectories:
   - `/sboms/app-a/`: 15 SBOM files
   - `/sboms/app-b/`: 12 SBOM files
   - `/sboms/app-c/`: 8 SBOM files
3. SBOM retention is **enabled** in `/configuration/config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   sbom_retention:
     enabled: true
     keep_versions_per_app: 10
   ```

4. Total size of `/sboms/` is 500 MB (below the 1200 MB limit)

**Trigger:**

Instance pipeline (GitLab or GitHub) is started with parameters:

1. `ENV_NAMES: <env_name>`
2. `GENERATE_EFFECTIVE_SET: true`

**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs.
2. SBOM retention is enabled with `keep_versions_per_app: 10`. The cleanup procedure starts.
3. Any legacy flat SBOM files at the top of `/sboms/` are removed (none in this case).
4. For each per-application subdirectory, the 10 most recent files are kept and older files are
   deleted.
5. The total size of `/sboms/` after per-application SBOM retention is at or below the 1200 MB
   limit. The total size limit step does not run.
6. The effective set generation completes.

**Results:**

1. Effective set is generated successfully
2. SBOM files are cleaned up per application:
   - `/sboms/app-a/`: 10 most recently modified files are kept, the 5 oldest are deleted
   - `/sboms/app-b/`: 10 most recently modified files are kept, the 2 oldest are deleted
   - `/sboms/app-c/`: all 8 files are kept (count is at or below `keep_versions_per_app`)
3. Total files deleted: 7 SBOM files
4. Pipeline log shows:
   - `SBOM retention policy is enabled for directory <path>/sboms`
   - `Only 10 files will remain in <path>/sboms/app-a` (and a `Removing file:` line per deleted
     file)
   - `Only 10 files will remain in <path>/sboms/app-b` (and a `Removing file:` line per deleted
     file)
   - `Directory size <X> MB`

### UC-SBOM-4: Per-application retention with custom version count

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Instance Repository exists with `/sboms/` directory
2. SBOM files exist for application `postgres` under `/sboms/postgres/`: 10 SBOM files
3. SBOM retention is **enabled** with custom settings in `/configuration/config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   sbom_retention:
     enabled: true
     keep_versions_per_app: 3  # only keep 3 most recent versions
   ```

4. Total size of `/sboms/` is 350 MB (below the 1200 MB limit)

**Trigger:**

Instance pipeline (GitLab or GitHub) is started with parameters:

1. `ENV_NAMES: <env_name>`
2. `GENERATE_EFFECTIVE_SET: true`

**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs.
2. SBOM retention is enabled with `keep_versions_per_app: 3`. The cleanup procedure starts.
3. Any legacy flat SBOM files at the top of `/sboms/` are removed (none in this case).
4. For `/sboms/postgres/`, the 3 most recent files are kept and the 7 older files are deleted.
5. The total size of `/sboms/` after per-application SBOM retention is at or below the 1200 MB
   limit. The total size limit step does not run.
6. The effective set generation completes.

**Results:**

1. Effective set is generated successfully
2. SBOM files under `/sboms/postgres/` are cleaned up:
   - 3 most recently modified files are kept
   - 7 oldest files are deleted
3. Total files deleted: 7 SBOM files
4. Pipeline log shows:
   - `SBOM retention policy is enabled for directory <path>/sboms`
   - `Only 3 files will remain in <path>/sboms/postgres` (and a `Removing file:` line per
     deleted file)
   - `Directory size <X> MB`

### UC-SBOM-5: Total /sboms/ size exceeds 1200 MB - keeps newest per application

**Pre-requisites:**

1. Instance Repository exists with `/sboms/` directory
2. SBOM files exist for several applications. Each subdirectory already contains
   `keep_versions_per_app` files or fewer, but the individual SBOM files are unusually large
3. SBOM retention is **enabled** in `/configuration/config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   sbom_retention:
     enabled: true
     keep_versions_per_app: 10
   ```

4. Total size of `/sboms/` is 1300 MB (above the 1200 MB limit). Per-application retention is not
   able to reduce the total below the limit because no per-application subdirectory exceeds
   `keep_versions_per_app`

**Trigger:**

Instance pipeline (GitLab or GitHub) is started with parameters:

1. `ENV_NAMES: <env_name>`
2. `GENERATE_EFFECTIVE_SET: true`

**Steps:**

1. The `generate_effective_set` job runs.
2. SBOM retention is enabled with `keep_versions_per_app: 10`. The cleanup procedure starts.
3. Any legacy flat SBOM files at the top of `/sboms/` are removed (none in this case).
4. Per-application SBOM retention runs over each subdirectory. No subdirectory exceeds
   `keep_versions_per_app`, so no per-application files are deleted.
5. The total size of `/sboms/` exceeds the 1200 MB limit. The total size limit step runs over
   each subdirectory and keeps only the most recently modified file. Older files in each
   subdirectory are deleted.
6. The effective set generation completes.

**Results:**

1. Effective set is generated successfully
2. Only the single most recent SBOM file remains under each `/sboms/<application-name>/`. Older
   versions are deleted. Subsequent pipeline runs that need previous versions will regenerate
   them, which is a costly operation
3. Pipeline log shows:
   - `SBOM retention policy is enabled for directory <path>/sboms`
   - `Directory size 1300.00 MB`
   - `SBOM directory exceeds size limit, starting cleanup: <path>/sboms`
   - `Only 1 files will remain in <path>/sboms/<application-name>` (one per subdirectory that
     had more than one file), and a `Removing file: <path>` line per deleted file
